"You might ask why we have to create a new distribution for that, instead of "
"creating improvements inside Debian? Creating a new distribution allows us "
"to do stuff we can never do in Debian, for example including more firmware "
"by default and having a time-based release cycle. These are already things "
"which are a no-go for Debian, and that’s fine. We don’t want Debian to "
"support these cases, as it is already a great distribution. We want to offer "
"a distro as close to Debian as possible, but with a few modifications for "
"use-cases which are not covered by Debian itself, and by doing that add "
"value to the Debian ecosystem. Of course we will participate in the "

"Tanglu is not an 'offical' Debian project, although it was started together "
"with some Debian Developers. But we think that Tanglu might help Debian. We "
"will sync the permissions of all Debian developers, so they can maintain "
"their packages in Tanglu during a Debian freeze if they want to do that, so "
"Tanglu and it's users get the latest upstream software, while Debian can "
"start the new release cycle with already tested packages from Tanglu. We "
"believe that this will increase the package quality and result in a less "
"rough start of Debian development after a freeze. However, Tanglu is not a "
"Debian experimental distribution or playground for untested software. "
"Everything in Tanglu should be usable for it's users and be released "
"upstream software. We are in contact with Debian and try to keep the delta "
"between Tanglu and Debian as low as possible, so we do not introduce "
"incompatibilities."

msgid ""
"Yes and no, yes because we need money to rent our servers and stuff, and no "
"by there is no company dictating the flow of the project. We believe in "
"meritocracy, if some company decides to put lots of developers to work with "
"us it's natural that they will be able to control what they are helping, the "
